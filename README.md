# Javascript Frameworks CA

The website includes these features:

- Homepage that lists all products and has a look-ahead search bar
- Individual product page with add to cart button
- Cart page/checkout page that shows all products and a total price. It includes a checkout button that clears the cart and takes the user to the checkout success page.
- Checkout success page with a back to store button

- Cart icon in header that acts as a button and displays the current number of items in the cart
